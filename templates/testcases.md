## 🛠️ Applied Test Design Techniques

The following techniques MUST be listed. For each, describe what was specifically validated:

- **Happy Path:** [e.g., Validated successful end-to-end registration and login flows.]
- **Negative Testing:** [e.g., Validated invalid credentials, duplicate registrations.]
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):** [e.g., Validated exact min/max limits for password length, OTP retry counts.]
- **Security Testing:** [e.g., Validated brute-force protection, session hijacking, scraping prevention.]
- **Advanced Edge Cases:** [e.g., Validated concurrent API spam, time boundary for lockout expiration, network interruptions during multi-step uploads.]
- **UI/UX Validation:** [e.g., Validated screen rendering against design files in `docs/design/`.]

> **Rule**: If the `advanced_edge_case_analyzer` agent was executed in the workflow, the `Advanced Edge Cases` bullet MUST be populated with specific findings. Do NOT omit this line.

## 📐 Applied Generation Rules

## 🧨 Edge Case Summary

> This section maps edge cases from the Edge Case Report into the test suite. Each row traces an edge case finding back to its source and the test case(s) that cover it.

| Edge Case ID | Source | Description | Mapped Test Case(s) |
|-------------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| [EDGE-001] | [Edge Case Report] | [e.g., Concurrent OTP API spam] | [e.g., REG-AUTH3-005] |
| [EDGE-002] | [Edge Case Report] | [e.g., Lockout timer BVA] | [e.g., REG-AUTH1-011] |

> **Rule**: If no Edge Case Report exists for this requirement, write "N/A — Edge Case Analyzer was not executed in this workflow run."

## 🔥 Risk Summary

> This section maps risks from the Risk Analysis Report into the test suite. Each row traces a risk finding to the test case(s) that verify its mitigation.

| Risk ID | Requirement | Risk Description | Level | Mapped Test Case(s) |
|---------|------------|------------------|-------|---------------------|
| [RISK-001] | [FR-XXX] | [e.g., Brute-force login attacks] | [🟠 High] | [e.g., REG-AUTH1-008, REG-AUTH1-010] |
| [RISK-002] | [FR-XXX] | [e.g., Session hijacking] | [🟠 High] | [e.g., REG-AUTH1-018, REG-AUTH1-020] |

> **Rule**: If no Risk Analysis Report exists for this requirement, write "N/A — Risk Analyst was not executed in this workflow run."

## ✅ Self-Review Audit

> The generator MUST perform a self-review audit before finalizing the report. List all checks and their status.

This template defines the standard output structure for generated manual test cases.

The generated test suite shall be:

- Executable
- Traceable
- Excel-ready
- Peer-review ready
- Automation planning ready

This template defines **output format only**. All generation logic and validation rules are governed by `rules/test_generation_rules.md`.

---

# Output Rules

- Generate ONE test case per row.
- Follow the exact column order.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder columns.
- **CSV Stability Warning**: Do not modify column names or insert secondary tables (such as Metadata) inside the main test case table block. Doing so breaks the CSV export parser script.
- Use HTML `<br>` tags for multiple test steps so it renders correctly in Markdown, but ensure the descriptions are as detailed and literal as if they were written for Excel.
- Every test case must reference exactly one primary Functional Requirement (FR ID).
- Leave Remarks empty unless required by generation rules.
- **CRITICAL DETAIL LEVEL**: The test cases must be EXTREMELY specific. Use exact wording for UI elements (e.g., "Top navigation bar titled 'Subscription' with back arrow"), specify exact visual states (e.g., "active blue background state", "light-blue pill badge"), and specify exact dynamic behaviors (e.g., "Prices dynamically recalculate and update across Basic and Premium cards in real-time"). Vague steps or expected results are NOT allowed.

PROFILE-UPDATE-005

BOOKING-CANCEL-012
```

Test Case IDs shall be unique.

## Steps Description

Rules

- One action per step.
- Every step begins with **Step X:**
- Multiple steps use HTML `<br>`.

## Expected Result

Expected Result SHALL describe observable system behavior, including precise UI details, copy, and transitions.

### Good Examples

```
Navigates to Subscriptions Overview; recommended plan is highlighted & scrolled into view.

Top navigation bar titled "Subscription" with back arrow. Hero shows 3D piggy-bank icon, bold primary headline, and exact subheadline. Status row shows (ⓘ) "You are currently on the Free plan".

Selected toggle renders with an active blue background state; inactive Monthly displays standard neutral grey background state. Annual displays embedded badge "Save 20%".

Prices dynamically recalculate and update across Basic and Premium cards in real-time without executing full screen reloads. Monthly toggle restores base prices.

Displays plan name "Basic Plan", light-blue pill badge "Value" anchored right. Active price format is bold blue "$9.99 /mo". CTA button explicitly reads "View more & Get Basic Now".
```

### Bad Examples
