# 🧪 UAT Script Generator Skill (Production Version)

---

## 🧩 Skill Metadata

- **name:** uat_script_generator
- **version:** 3.0.0
- **description:** Generate comprehensive business-oriented User Acceptance Test (UAT) scripts from SRS, Business Rules, Test Scenarios, and UI specifications to validate business processes, user journeys, and acceptance criteria before production release.
- **category:** QA / UAT / Business Validation
- **author:** System

---

# 🎯 Purpose

Generate executable **User Acceptance Test (UAT)** scripts that validate business requirements from an end-user perspective.

The generated scripts should help business users determine whether the system is ready for production.

Focus on:

- Business Processes
- End-to-End Workflows
- User Journeys
- Acceptance Criteria
- Business Rules
- Role-based Operations
- Business Outcomes

Unlike QA Test Cases, UAT Scripts should:

- Be easy for business users to execute.
- Avoid technical implementation details.
- Validate business value instead of technical behavior.

# 3. UAT Script Generation Rules

Each business process must generate at least one UAT script.

Each script shall include:

- Objective
- Preconditions
- Test Data
- Business Actions
- Expected Business Outcome
- Acceptance Criteria

Scripts should simulate real user behavior.

---

# 4. Role-based UAT Generation

Generate scripts for applicable roles:

- Finance
- Support
- Auditor

Only include roles defined in the SRS.

---

# 5. End-to-End Workflow Coverage

Ensure every critical workflow has complete coverage.

Examples:

- User Registration
- Login
- Product Purchase
- Payment
- Refund
- Order Approval
- Report Generation
- Account Management

Each workflow should validate the entire business process from start to finish.

---

# 6. Business Acceptance Validation

Verify:

- Business Rules
- Approval Logic
- Workflow Completion
- Notifications
- Generated Reports
- User Permissions
- Data Visibility
- Business Calculations
- Financial Accuracy

---

# 7. Priority Assignment

| Business Flow | Priority |
|---------------|----------|
|Financial Transactions|P0|
|Payment|P0|
|Authentication|P0|
|Order Processing|P1|
|Approval Workflow|P1|
|Inventory Management|P1|
|Reporting|P2|
|Administration|P2|
|Settings|P3|

---

# 8. Risk-based UAT Enhancement

If `reports/*_Risk_Analysis_Report.md` is available:

Generate additional UAT scripts for:

- Critical Business Risks
- High-risk Financial Operations
- High-risk Approval Workflows
- High-impact Customer Journeys

Mark these scripts as:

```text
[RISK-DRIVEN]
```

---

# 9. Traceability Rules

Each UAT Script must map to:

Requirement

↓

Business Rule

↓

Business Flow

↓

Acceptance Criteria

↓

Test Scenario

↓

UAT Script

---

# 10. Script Quality Rules

Each script must be:

- Business-oriented
- Easy to understand
- Independent
- Repeatable
- Traceable
- Realistic
- Technology independent

Avoid technical terminology whenever possible.

---

# 11. Duplicate Detection

Merge scripts that validate the same business objective.

Avoid duplicate business flows.

---

# 🔁 Failure Handling Rules

### If SRS cannot be parsed

- Stop generation
- Produce error report

---

### If Business Rules are missing

Continue generation.

Clearly identify assumptions.

---

### If Acceptance Criteria are missing

Generate proposed acceptance criteria.

Mark confidence as **Medium**.
