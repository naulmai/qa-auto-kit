## 🧩 Skill Metadata

- **name:** advanced_edge_case_analyzer
- **version:** 3.0.0
- **description:** Analyze Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to discover high-risk edge cases, boundary conditions, concurrency issues, state interruptions, distributed system failures, and hidden business logic defects. Assess risk, recommend mitigation strategies, and map findings to testing activities.
- **category:** QA / Risk Engineering / Edge Case Analysis
- **author:** System

# 🎯 Purpose

Unlike normal Test Scenario generation, this skill focuses on discovering **rare but high-impact failures** that frequently escape functional testing.

Primary objectives:

- Discover hidden edge cases
- Identify concurrency issues
- Analyze state transition failures
- Detect distributed system risks
- Evaluate boundary conditions
- Reveal business logic weaknesses
- Prioritize testing based on risk
- Recommend mitigation strategies

# ⚙️ Core Processing Rules

---

## 1. Requirement Analysis

Analyze every requirement independently.

Extract:

- Business Logic
- Validation Rules
- Constraints
- State Changes
- External Dependencies
- User Actions

One requirement may produce multiple Edge Cases.

---

# 2. Edge Case Discovery Categories

Examples:

- Browser closed during payment
- App crashes while saving
- Network disconnected during API request

- Device reboot during upload

---

## 2.2 Concurrency / Race Condition

Examples:

- Double-click Submit
- Two users editing the same record
- Multiple payment requests
- Parallel API requests
- Out-of-order request arrival
- Simultaneous stock deduction

---

## 2.3 Data Extremes

Examples:

- Maximum integer
- Minimum integer
- Empty value

## 2.6 State Transition

Detect invalid transitions.

Examples:

---

## 2.8 Resource Exhaustion

Evaluate:

- Memory full
- Disk full
- CPU overload
- Connection pool exhausted
- Thread pool exhausted
- Queue overflow

---

## 2.9 Cache Consistency

Examples:

- Stale cache
- Cache race
- Cache invalidation
- Distributed cache inconsistency
- Missing cache refresh

---

## 2.10 Distributed System Failures

Applicable for microservices.

Examples:

- Lost event
- Duplicate event
- Delayed event
- Event replay
- Event ordering
- Partial failure
- Saga rollback failure

---

## 2.11 Offline / Network Recovery

Examples:

- Offline → Online
- Weak Network
- Packet Loss
- Retry after reconnect
- Airplane Mode
- Switching WiFi to Mobile Data

---

## 2.12 Multi-device Conflict

Examples:

- Edit on Web and Mobile simultaneously
- Logout on another device
- Shared account update conflict
- Session synchronization issues

---

## 2.13 Session Management

Examples:

- Concurrent login
- Session timeout
- Token refresh race
- Refresh Token expired
- Logout during transaction

---

# 3. Severity Assessment

Every Edge Case must have a severity.

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
|🔴 Critical|Financial loss, security breach, data corruption, irreversible failure|
|🟠 High|Major business interruption, system crash|
|🟡 Medium|Incorrect behavior with recovery possible|
|🟢 Low|Minor issue or cosmetic problem|

---

# 4. Risk Scoring

Calculate:

```
Risk Score = Impact × Likelihood × Detectability
```

| Score | Level |
|--------|------|
|40–75|Critical|
|20–39|High|
|10–19|Medium|
|1–9|Low|

---

# 5. Root Cause Classification

Assign one or more root causes.

Categories:

- Business Logic
- Validation
- Concurrency
- State Management
- Database
- API Design
- Infrastructure
- Security
- Performance
- UI
- Network

---

# 6. Technical Recommendations

Each Edge Case MUST include mitigation recommendations.

Possible recommendations:

- Idempotency Key
- Optimistic Locking
- Pessimistic Locking
- Database Transaction
- Rollback
- Retry Mechanism
- Debounce
- Throttle
- Queue Processing
- Circuit Breaker
- Timeout
- Rate Limiting
- Cache Invalidation
- Audit Logging

Recommendations must explain **why** they reduce the identified risk.

|--------|-------------|
|Easy|Can be automated via API/UI|
|Medium|Requires environment setup|
|Hard|Requires multiple users/devices|

---

# 8. Confidence Assessment

Every Edge Case must include confidence.

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
|High|Explicitly supported by requirements|
|Medium|Strong inference|
|Low|Assumption due to missing information|

Low-confidence findings must clearly explain:

- Assumptions made
- Missing information
- Additional clarification required

---

# 9. Mapping Rules

Each Edge Case must be linked to:

Requirement

↓

Business Rule

↓

Risk

↓

Test Scenario

↓

Test Case

↓

Mitigation

---

# 10. Duplicate Handling

Merge Edge Cases sharing the same:

- Root Cause
- Failure Mechanism
- Risk

Do NOT generate duplicate findings.

---

# 11. Exclusions

Do NOT include basic negative test cases such as:

- Required field validation
- Invalid password
- Invalid email
- Empty mandatory fields
- Incorrect format validation

These belong to Test Scenario or Test Case generation.

Focus only on **true Edge Cases**.

---

# 🔁 Failure Handling Rules

If SRS cannot be parsed:

- Stop analysis
- Generate error report

If insufficient information exists:

- Continue analysis
- Mark finding with Low Confidence
